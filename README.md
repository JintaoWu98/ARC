**ARC - Automated Rate Calculator** is a software for automating
electronic structure calculations relevant for chemical kinetic modeling.
ARC has many advanced options, yet at its core it is simple: it accepts 2D
graph representations of chemical species (e.g., SMILES or adjacency lists),
and  automatically executes, tracks, and processes relevant electronic structure
jobs on user-defined servers. The principal outputs of ARC are thermodynamic properties
(H, S, Cp) and high-pressure limit kinetic rate coefficients for the defined species
and reactions.
(Note that automating transition states is still in progress).
