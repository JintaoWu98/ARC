Release notes
=============

ARC 1.0.0
^^^^^^^^^

This is the first stable version of ARC. See the API.

It has reasonable capabilities to calculate thermodynamic properties for arbitrary species.
It has the capability of calculating reaction rates, yet a user guess for the
transition state geometry should be provided.
(ARC can use `AutoTST`__ to generate such guesses for hydrogen abstraction reactions only,
though not all chemical elements are supported by AutoTST)

__ autotst_

Version style
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ARC uses `Semantic Versioning`__
